    "description": "This is our 2nd year hosting Paco Bazaar - a mini marketplace showcasing new branded items, fan art and crafts created by MIND's talented colleagues!  All proceeds from Paco Bazaar benefit a local charity or school in need.  Our last bazaar raised nearly $2,000 to buy furniture and supplies for a special needs classroom in Orange County.  Come see what your artistic colleagues have created with our favorite characters! Please bring cash/check for payment."
