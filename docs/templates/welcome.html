        <h1 class="welcome-header">Welcome to MINDShare!</h1>
        <p>This year’s theme is <b>MINDmatters: P<sup>3</sup></b></p>
        <p>MINDmatters represents our focus this year. It’s a time for us to celebrate the significance of what we do – our work, our people, our mission, our customers, donors, schools, students, parents, educators… everything and everyone matters!</p>
        <p>At MINDShare 2018, what you’ll experience is represented by P<sup>3</sup>: Purpose, People and Passion.</p>
        <ul class="welcome-list">
          <li>Purpose – getting back to our mission and what drives us to do what we do.</li>
          <li>People – identifying ways to support our customers, our donors and each other.</li>
          <li>Passion – we are all here because we believe in our cause and we know that what we do makes a difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <b>#mindshare2018</b> channel on Slack is the place for all things MINDShare 2018. Please post updates, fabulous photos and any event questions in the channel. <em>Share</em> your MIND love!</p>
